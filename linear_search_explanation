int n;
Declares an integer variable n.
This will store the size of the array.
cout << "Enter array size: ";
Prints a message asking the user to input the array size.
cin >> n;
Takes input from the user and stores it in n.
int arr[n];
Creates an integer array of size n.
So if the user enters 5, this becomes int arr[5];.
cout << "Enter " << n << " elements: ";
Asks the user to enter n elements.
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
This loop runs from index 0 to n-1.
It will execute n times.
cin >> arr[i];
Stores each user input into the array at index i.
int key;
Declares an integer variable key.
This is the number we want to search.
cout << "Enter the number to search: ";
Asks the user which number they want to find.
cin >> key;
Stores that number in the variable key.
bool found = false;
Creates a boolean variable named found.
Initially set to false because we haven’t found the element yet.
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
Another loop that checks each element of the array one by one.
if(arr[i] == key) {
Compares the current array element with the search value (key).
If they are equal, it means we found the element.
cout << "Element found at index: " << i << endl;
Prints the index where the element is found.
found = true;
Updates the boolean variable to true since the element is found.
break;
Stops the loop immediately.
No need to continue searching once we find the element.
if(!found) {
After the loop ends, this checks:
If found is still false, it means the element was not in the array.
cout << "Element not found." << endl;
Prints a message saying the element does not exist in the array.
