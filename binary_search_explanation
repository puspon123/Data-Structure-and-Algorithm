int n;
Declares an integer variable n.
This will store the size of the array.
cout << "Enter array size: ";
Prints a message asking the user to input the array size.
cin >> n;
Stores the user input into n.
int arr[n];
Creates an array of size n. Important: The array must be sorted for Binary Search to work.
cout << "Enter " << n << " sorted elements: ";
Asks the user to enter n elements in sorted order.
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
Loop runs from 0 to n-1.
cin >> arr[i];
Stores each input into the array.
int key;
Declares the variable that will store the value to search.
cout << "Enter the number to search: ";
Asks which number to find.
cin >> key;
Stores that number into key.
int left = 0, right = n - 1;
Defines the search boundaries.
left = starting index
right = last index
Binary search always works between these two limits.
bool found = false;
Initially assume the element is not found.
while(left <= right)
Loop continues as long as the search range is valid.
If left becomes greater than right, search stops.
int mid = (left + right) / 2;
Finds the middle index.
This divides the array into two halves.
if(arr[mid] == key)
If middle element equals the search value → success.
cout << "Element found at index: " << mid << endl;
Prints the position where it was found.
found = true;
Marks that the element is found.
break;
Stops the loop immediately. No need to continue.
else if(arr[mid] < key)
If middle value is smaller than the key:
That means the key must be in the right half.
left = mid + 1;
Ignore left half.
Move the left boundary to the right side.
else
If middle value is greater than the key:
That means the key must be in the left half.
right = mid - 1;
Ignore right half.
Move the right boundary to the left side.
if(!found)
After loop ends, check if we never found the element.
cout << "Element not found." << endl;
Prints message if the element does not exist.
